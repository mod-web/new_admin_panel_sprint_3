## How to start the project:

Create and set env according to example.env in root directory.

### Run docker-compose with this command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
or background mode:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

When you initialize the project, it will automatically load data from Sqlite into Postgres, migrate to Django, and set up a superuser. After that the ETL process (transform, extract, load) will start, data will transfer from Postgres to Elasticsearch.
